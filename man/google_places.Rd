\arguments{
\item{search_string}{\code{string} A search term representing a place for which to search. If blank, the \code{location} argument must be used.}

\item{location}{\code{numeric} vector of latitude/longitude coordinates (in that order) around which to retrieve place information. If blank, the \code{search_string} argument must be used. If used in absence of a \code{search_string}, If used in conjunction with \code{search_string} it represents the latitude/longitude around which to retrieve place information, and must be used in conjunction with \code{radius}.}

\item{radar}{\code{boolean} The Google Places API Radar Search Service allows you to search for up to 200 places at once, but with less detail than is typically returned from a Text Search (\code{search_string}) or Nearby Search (\code{location}) request. A radar search must contain a \code{location} and \code{radius}, and one of \code{keyword}, \code{name} or \code{type}. A radar search will not use a \code{search_string}}

\item{radius}{\code{numeric} Defines the distance (in meters) within which to return place results. The maximum allowed radius is 50,000 meters. Note that radius must not be included if \code{rankby="distance"} is specified.}

\item{rankby}{\code{string} Specifies the order in which results are listed. Possible values are \code{"prominence"}, \code{"distance"} or \code{"location"}. If \code{rankby = distance}, then one of \code{keyword}, \code{name} or \code{type} must be specified. If a \code{search_string} is used then \code{rankby} is ignored}

\item{keyword}{\code{string} A term to be matched against all content that Google has indexed for this place, including but not limited to name, type, and address, as well as customer reviews and other third-party content.}

\item{language}{\code{string} The language code, indicating in which language the results should be returned, if possible. Searches are also biased to the selected language; results in the selected language may be given a higher ranking. See the list of supported languages and their codes \url{https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport}}

\item{name}{\code{string} \code{vector} One or more terms to be matched against the names of places. Ignored when used with a \code{search_string}. Results will be restricted to those containing the passed \code{name} values. Note that a place may have additional names associated with it, beyond its listed name. The API will try to match the passed name value against all of these names. As a result, places may be returned in the results whose listed names do not match the search term, but whose associated names do.}

\item{type}{\code{string} Restricts the results to places matching the specified type. Only one type may be specified (if more than one type is provided, all types following the first entry are ignored). For a list of valid types, please visit \url{https://developers.google.com/places/supported_types}}

\item{simplify}{logical Inidicates if the returned JSON should be coerced into a list}

\item{price_range}{\code{numeric} \code{vector} Specifying the minimum and maximum price ranges. Values range between 0 (most affordable) and 4 (most expensive)}

\item{page_token}{\code{string} Returns the next 20 results from a previously run search. Setting a pagetoken parameter will execute a search with the same parameters used previously â€” all parameters other than pagetoken will be ignored. The \code{page_token} can be found in the result set of a previously run query}

\item{key}{\code{string} A valid Google Developers Places API key}

\description{
The Google Places API Web Service allows you to query for place information on a variety of categories, such as: establishments, prominent points of interest, geographic locations, and more.

\details{
You can search for places either by proximity or a text string. A Place Search returns a list of places along with summary information about each place; additional information is available via a Place Details query.

The \code{search_string} argument is only needed if you are searching by a
